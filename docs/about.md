# ℹ️ About Via Browser Hub

**Via Browser Hub** is a personal project by *Noushad* — built to make browsing on **Via Browser** faster, cleaner, and more private.  

This site brings together two main resources:

- ⚡ **Userscripts** → Lightweight scripts that enhance performance, fix dark mode, block ads, and add useful tweaks.  
- 🛡️ **Filterlists** → Curated subscriptions from trusted sources like EasyList, EasyPrivacy, AdGuard, HaGeZi, and more.  

---

## 🎯 Mission
To provide a **minimal, modern, and user‑friendly hub** where anyone can install scripts and filters with a single tap — no clutter, no confusion, just practical tools.

- Optimizing devices and apps for peak performance  
- Building tactical strategies in games like eFootball & Free Fire  
- Curating and beautifying technical projects for community use  

This hub is my way of blending those skills into something useful for others.
